# WPILib Branding Standards

This repository contains WPILib's branding standards and guidelines.

## Logo
Branding standards for the logo can be found here: [Logo Branding Guide](WPILib-Logo-Branding-Guidelines-2024.pdf)

## Font

We also use [DejaVu Sans](DejaVuSans.ttf), so we recommend using this font on other branding material for consistency.
